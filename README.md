# Direct and indirect effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in individuals with cardiovascular disease

## Project description

Coronavirus (COVID-19) directly impacts individuals who become infected with the virus. It can also influence people’s healthcare decisions (such as deciding not to attend medical appointments for fear of infection). In addition, hospitals have sometimes had to prioritise treatment of COVID-19 patients over routine healthcare.

Access to data from healthcare records will help to improve our understanding of what puts certain people at an increased level of risk. This includes people with cardiovascular disease, including heart disease and stroke.

This research project has three main priorities:

* For people with cardiovascular disease, we will estimate by how much becoming infected or unwell with COVID-19 increases their risk of dying within one year of infection. This will involve analysing routine healthcare data from multiple sources, including from general practices, hospitals and national death registers.
* We will study how the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease has been affected during the pandemic.
* We will develop and improve models that predict the risk of dying at one year among people with cardiovascular disease who have and who have not contracted COVID-19.

Our research will help to shape health policy, help patients and clinicians to make more informed decisions, and improve health outcomes.
